A demonstration of simple RESTful service, to perform CRUD operations towards a MongoDB collection for arbitrary JSON documents.

The RESTful operations include:

GET from http://.../restAPI/items/{id},    get one document with specific ID (returning document ID as well as raw contents)
GET from http://.../restAPI/items/,        get all documents (returning document IDs as well as raw contents)
POST/PUT to http://.../restAPI/items,      add a new document.
POST/PUT to http://.../restAPI/items/{id}, update an existing document.
DELETE from http://.../restAPI/items{id},  delete an existing document.

JSON format for single document (POST/PUT, or GET for one document)
{ "id" : string,
  "document" : { ... }
}

JSON format for multiple documents (GET all documents)
[ { "id" : string,
    "document" : {...}
  }
  { "id" : string,
    "document" : {...}
  }
  ...
]

HTTP status code to return:
200 OK,          for normal successful operation, except for adding a new document
202 Created,     for successfully adding a document
404 Not found,   if the specified document id is not found
400 Bad request, if the body of POST/PUT is not a valid JSON document
500 Internal Server Error, for all other erros.

Techniques/frameworks used:

Spring MVC framework, with RESTful controller
Spring Boot with integrated Tomcat server
Spring data for Mongodb
JUnit testing for service layer, with Mockito as mocked repository
JUnit semi-integration testing with Spring MVC test framework, connecting the controller, service and repository.
